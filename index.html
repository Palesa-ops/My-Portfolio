            <h2>More About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p id="short-text">I'm a passionate and self-taught software developer with a growing interest in data analytics. 
               Even though I don’t have professional experience yet, I’ve built hands-on projects and I’m currently developing a donation platform to support children with disabilities , inspired by a boy who lived on the streets with his mom that had down syndrome as well as hydrocephalus. 
               I’m constantly learning, improving, and exploring new technologies. I'm also diving into data tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL to sharpen my analytical skills and turn insights into impactful decisions. 
               I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute, grow, and turn ideas into real-world solutions.</p>

               <p id="more-text" style="display: none;">Even though I am a self-taught software developer I have a full passion for building meaningful solutions and a growing skillset in data analytics as well.
                  I’ve created real-world projects like a weather app, a coffee shop website, and a donation platform for children with disabilities — each one teaching me to write clean code, solve problems, and think creatively.
                  I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in front-end technologies and data tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to turn data into powerful insights. 
                  What drives me is the opportunity to make a difference through technology.
                  I'm excited to join a team where I can grow, collaborate, and contribute to impactful work from day one.</p>
